# ðŸ§  Code Journal

Welcome to my personal code journal â€” a daily log of small wins, experiments, practice snippets, and learning moments.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This repo is a digital trail of my consistent developer journey from January 2025 onward.  
Each commit reflects:
- Practice with tools & frameworks
- Bug fixes or ideas
- Notes on what Iâ€™m learning

## ðŸŸ© Why this exists

Sometimes, progress is silent. This repo is proof that **consistency beats perfection**.
